## The Zendesk Support Tickets Connector

Extremely useful connector to fetch Zendesk Support views and tickets information from Zendesk. The connector uses OAuth 2.0 to access your Zendesk's account data.

### Setup

1. Register an OAuth 2.0 client.

Make sure to provide "redirect_url" as https://oauth.powerbi.com/views/oauthredirect.html 

Read more [here][zendesk-app]

See screenshot below for quick navigation

2. Grab client id and secret

Client Id is nothing but the unique identifier.

4. Rename ZendeskSupport.mez to ZendeskSupport.zip

5. Unzip the contents, and edit config.json in Notepad or any text editor

6. Replace your_client_id and your_client_secret with your apps client_id and client_secret

7. Save the file, and zip the contents again. Please make sure you select all content (Ctrl+A), right click and send to Compressed (zipped) folder.

8. Rename the zip back to .mez
