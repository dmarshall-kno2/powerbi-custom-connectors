## The Zendesk Support Tickets Connector

Extremely useful connector to fetch Zendesk Support views and tickets information from Zendesk. The connector uses OAuth 2.0 to access your Zendesk's account data.

### Setup

1. Register an OAuth 2.0 client.

Make sure to provide "redirect_url" as https://oauth.powerbi.com/views/oauthredirect.html

See screenshot below for quick navigation

2. Grab client id and secret

Client Id is nothing but the unique identifier.

4. Rename ZendeskSupport.mez to ZendeskSupport.zip

5. Unzip the contents, and edit config.json in Notepad or any text editor
